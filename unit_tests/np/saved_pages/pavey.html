Presentation
to
the
Rev.
J.
W.
Sampson.—
On
Tuesday
last,
the
membera
of
the
Bible
Class
connected
with
the
Congregational
Chapel,
Yeovil,
—of
which
the
Rev.
J.
W.
Sampson
is
the
teacher
—held
their
anniversary.
It
has
been
the
custom
«f
the
cla*s,
for
some
years
past,
to
hold
a
meeting
«uf
this
description,
prefacing
it
with
a
tea,
to
which
they
were
in
the
habit
of
inviting
their
teacher
and
3lrs.
Samoson.
But
on
this
occasion
additional
interest
was
excited
by
the
fact
that
it
was
the
last
time
that
they
would
have
the
opportunity
of
•meeting
Mr.
Sampson,
a3
he
is
about
to
leave
Yeovil
to
take
charge
of
a
ohurch
in
the
suburbs
of
Bristol.
Nearly
the
whole
of
the
class
were
present,
and
a
most
enjoyable
evening
was
spent.
The
programme
consisted
of
a
selection
of
music,
performed
by
members
of
the
class,
under
the
leadership
of
Mr.
Dove,
who
presided
at
the
harmonium
;
addresses
by
the
Rev.
J.
W.
Sampson,
and
Messrs.
Hawkins,
Marsh,
Dove,
and
Anthony
;
and
recitations
by
Mr.
Durrant,
Mrs.
Walker,
Miss
Sydenham,
Mrs.
Dove,
and
Misses
Selway
and
Hurleston.
But
the
most
prominent
feature
In
the
programme
was
the
presentation
of
a
vary
handsome
salver,
together
with
an
albam,
containing
tho
portraits
of
the
members
of
the
class,
to
Mr.
Sampson.
The
presentation
was
made
by
Mr.
Marsh,
who
read
an
address
the
regret
the
class
felt
at
the
loss
they
were
about
to
sustain,
and
also
expressing
a
hope
that,
in
his
new
sphere,
the
labours
of
the
rev.
gentleman
might
bo
blessed
to
the
salvation
of
many
souls.
The
inscription
on
the
salver
was
as
follows:—"
Presented
to
the
Rev.
J.
W.
Sampson
by
the
members
of
his
Bible
Class,
as
a
token
of
affectionr-ta
esteem,
on
the
occasion
of
his
leaving
Yeovil,
September
21st,
1869."
Icwas
supplied
by
Messrs.
Hancock
and
Cox,
jaweller3,
of
YeOviL
In
thankingtho
class
for
the
salver
and
album,
Mr.
Sampson
remarked
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
h»d
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
them
at
their
anniversary,
find
receiving
from
their
hands
substantial
proofs
of
the
affection
with
which
he
kaew
they
regarded
him.
Theso
things
would
be
links
binding
them
to
each
other
as
long
as
he
lived
;
and,
although
distance
would
separate
them,
still.
his
spirit
would
often
hold
communion
with
their
spirits.
He
shou'd
ilways
regard
his
Bible
Class
as
one
of
the
brightest
spots
which
bad
marked
his
15
years'
stay
in
Yeovil
The
meeting
was
brought
to
a
close
at
about
nine
o'clock,
by
the
choir
singing
that
wellknown
hymn,
"
Abide
withme,"
and
by
the
Rev.
J.
W.
Sam
"
son
engaging
in
prayer.
It
will
be
seen,
by
an
adverHsemest
in
another
column,
that
a
congregational
and
public
farewell
tea-meeting
will
be
held
on
Tnesday
next.
The
Late
Mr.
Eli
as
Whitby.—The
remains
of
this
gentleman
were
interred
in
the
Cemetery
on
Saturday.
A
large
number
of
the
shops
were
partially
closed
during
the
afternoon.
The
funeral
procession
consisted
of
a
hearse
and
three
mourning
coaches,
tho
latter
containing
the
Rev.
J.
W.
Sampson,
Dr.
Tomkyns,
Mr.
Masters,
and
the
sons
and
grandsons
of
the
deceased.
Mr.
Ryall
was
the
under
taker.
At
the
top
of
Peter-street,
a
large
number
of
tradesmen
"fell
in"
in
front
of
the
hearse,
and
preceded
it
through
High
Street
and
Kingston
to
the
Cemetary.
Tha
funeral
service
was
conducted
by
tho
Rev.
J.
W.
Sampson.
On
Sunday
morning,
that
gentleman
preached
a
funeral
srrmon
at
the
Independent
Chapel,
which
was
crowded,
the
congregation
comprising
a
1
arge
number
of
the
members
of
the
late
Mr.
Whitby's
family,
and
many
of
the
regular
attendants
at
the
Baptist
Chapel.
At
the
close
of
the
sermon,
which
was
founded
ou
the
words
"Through
the
gates
into
the
city,"
Mr.
Sampson
stated
a
few
facts
relative
to
the
deceased
gentleman's
long
connection
with
the
Baptist
Church.
He
joined
that
Church
in
1805,
and
had
therefore
been
a
member
of
it
during
the
long
period
of
64
years.
In
1808,
he
was
appointed
deacon,
and
had
held
that
office
uninterruptedly
for
61
yeivs.
He
always
manfested
a
lively
interest
in
the
prosperity
of
tho
Baptist
cause,
and
at
least
one
church—that
at
Crewkerne—owed
its
existence
to
his
labours.
Mr.
Sampson
added
that
Mr.
Whitby
prayed
most
earnestly,
on
his
death-bed,
for
all
the
Sunday-shoois
in
the
town,
mentioning
eaeh
by
name
;
and
said
he
was
informed
that
every
wish
which
the
deceased
expressed
had
been
most
religiously
carried
out.
—In
the
evening,
the
Rev.
R
James
preached
a
funeral
sermon
at
the
Baptist
Chapel
from
the
words—"
For
ine
to
live
is
Christ's,
and
to
die
is
gain."
The
galleries,
pulpit,
&amp;c.,
were
draped
with
black,
and
the
chapel
was
crowded
long
before
tho
service
commenced.
At
the
close
of
his
sermon,
Mr.
James
read
a
short
history
of
the
late
gentleman's
connection
with
the
Baptist
Church,
the
salient
facts
of
which
we
have
already
stated
as
having
been
given
by
Mr.
Sampson
earlier
in
the
day.
Mr.
James
dwelt
specially
on
the
long
period
during
which
Mr.
Whitby
had
filled
the
office
of
deacon—from
the
year
up
to
the
very
moment
of
his
death.
He
stated
also
that
the
deceased
prayed
most
earnestly,
ia
his
last
hours,
for
the
Baptist
Church
and
its
minister,
as
well
as
for
the
Sundayschools
connected
with
his
own
place
of
worship
and
with
every
other
place
of
worship
in
the
town.
Both
Mr.
James
and
his
hearers,
with
whom
Mr.
Whitby
had
been
so
long
associated,
were
much
affected,
and
the
service
was
altogether
of
a
very
impressive
character.
Temperance
Society.—The
anniversary
of
this
society
was
held
on
Monday
last,
at
the
Corn
Exchange.
In
the
afternoon,
at
five
o'clock,
tea
was
provided,
to
which
the
very
small
number
of
only
86
persons
sat
down.
In
the
evening,
at
seven,
a
public
meeting
was
held
in
the
same
place,
and
this
presented
a
more
hopeful
appearance,
the
large
room
being
about
three
parts
full.
The
meeting
was
opened
by
the
Rev.
S.
Knell,
of
Throop,
who
offered
prayer.
Mr.
John
Perry
then
proposed
Mr.
Jato€9
Belben
as
oil
airman.
This
was
seconded
by
j
Mr.
T.
F.
Ewens,
aud
carried
by
acclamation.
Mr.
Belben
said
it
afforded
him
great
pleasure
to
be
placed
in
the
position
which
he
then
occupied.
He
had
been
connected
with
the
Temperance
movement
about
25
years,
and
it
always
gave
him
great
satisfaction
to
help
on
that
great
and
glorious
cause.
There
were
others
present
able
to
advocate
the
claims
of
the
society
far
better
than
himself,
and
he
should
call
on
them
to
address
the
meeting.
The
first
on
the
list
was
the
Rev.
H.
G.
Button,
of
Yeovil,
whom
he
knew
to
be
an
earnest
worker
in
the
cause
of
Christ,
and
also
an
earnest
advocate
and
staunch
follower
of
the
principles
of
total
abstinence.
The
Rev.
H.
G.
Button
gave
a
lengthened
and
forcible
address,
proving,
in
many
ways,
the
pernicious
influence
which
drink
exercised
over
society.
He
also
pointed
out
the
various
methods
which
might
be
used
to
stem
the
tide
of
drunkenness,
and
to
inculcate
the
principles
of
total
abstinence
into
the
minds
of
the
people.
—The
Rev.
S.
Knell,
the
secretary
of
the
Dorset
County
Temperance
Association,
fallowed,
and
reviewed
the
progress
of
that
society
from
its
formation
until
the
present
time.
He
gave
many
hints
relative
to
the
successful
working
of
societies
of
this
description,
and
then
took
a
more
general
vie
wof
the
Temperance
question,
remarking
that
this
was
an
age
of
process.
In
almost
every
department
of
science
and^art
progress
had
been
made
;
advancement
was
stamped
upon
everything.
While
all
things
else
had
been
moving
onward,
teetotalism
had
also
taken
some
rapid
strides,
and
where,
but
a
few
years
ago,
societies
might
have
been
seen
j'ist
in
their
infanoy,
there
were
now
societies
founded
on
a
strong
foundation,
which
not
all
the
assaults
of
the
enemy
could
shake.
He
quoted
Shakespeare,
John
Wesley,
Robert
Hall,
and
others
in
support
of
his
principles.
The
consumption
of
drink,
he
said,
was
soiall,
when
compared
with
the
quantity
consumed
20
years
Many
influences
had
been
brought
to
bear
against
the
drinking
customs.
The
press
had
raised
its
powerful
voice
and
demanded
the
destruction
of
the
deathdealing
tyrant,
Drink.
Even
the
comic
arm
of
that
press
was
heard
to
ring
with
teetotalism
;
and
from
it
had
proceeded
this
truth
"England
is
the
richest,
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
ragged,
nation
under'
heavon
!"
He
closed
by
earnestly
desiring
all
to
come
and
help
onward
this
great
and
good
cause.—The
chairman
then
called
on
the
Rev.
W.
Talbot,
Wesleyan
minister,
of
Yeovil,
who
remarked
that
wherever
he
went
he
was
always
ready
to
fight
the
battle
of
total
abstinence,
and
this
accounted
for
his
being
present
on
this
occasion.
He
was
a
Methodist;
aad
he
had
tha.
honour
of
being
the
youngest
son
of
a
lady,
who,
in
her
childhood,
had
sat
upon
the
knee
of
John
\\
esley.
To
be
called
a
Methodist
some
years
ago
was
a
term
of
reproach
;
but
the
time
had
come
wuen
it
was
said
"There
goes
a
man
who
i
3
almost
as
bad
as
a
Methodist
;
he
is
a
teetotaler.
H
0
®
like
every
teetotaler
to
be
a
Methodist;
but
he
hoped
the
time
would
come
when
every
Methodist
would
be
a
teetotaler.
John
Wesley
was
a
thorough
teetotaller,
and
his
advice
to
his
followers
wa3—
"Touch
not
the
dram,
it
is
liquid
fire."
Dr.
Guthrie,
when
asked
his
reasons
for
abstaining,
replied—"
My
hand
is
steadier,
my
head
is
clearer,
my
heart
is
lighter,
my
purse
is
heavier.
He
(the
speaker)
said
there
was
much
cause
for
thankfulness
in
the
fact
that
so
many
beerhouses
had
recently
been
closed
on
account
of
their
licenses
having
been
refused.
A
war
was
being
carried
on
between
truth
and
error,
virtue
and
vice,
God
and
the
devil.
He
would
not,
as
some
had,
place
teetotalism
before
the
Gospel,
but
give
it
its
right
place,
as
a
handmaid
of
the
Gospel
;
for
in
numberless.
instances
it
had
proved
itself
to
be
so.
The
evening's
proceedings
were
enlivened
by
the
performances
of
a
choir,
under
the
leadership
of
Mr.
G.
Hine
;
Mr.
Young
presiding
at
the
harmonium.
The
programme
consisting
of
the
anthems
"Jerusalem,
my
glorious
home,"
"I
will
lift
up
mine
eyes,"
"Behold
how
srood
and
joyful,"
and
"In
Jewry
is
God
known."
The
latter
piece
called
forth
an
eulogy
from
the
Rev.
W.
Talbot
Mr.
Hine
also
sang
a
solo
"Weep
not
for
mo."
After
votes
of
thanks
had
been
accorded
to
the
rev.
gentlemen,
to
the
choir,
(for
whom
Mr.
Hino
responded),
and
to
the
Chairman,
the
meeting
was
brought
to
a
close
by
singing
the
Doxology.

assault
case
Browning
v.
Prowl,
adjourned
from
the
last
meeting,
was
resumed,
and
Browning
gave
evidence
to
the
effect
that
Prowl
had
violently
struck
him
whilst
escorting
a
young
lady
home.
Prowl
considered
it
was
a
provoked
assault,
as
complainant
was
always
trying
to
"take
his
young
woman
away."
The
Bench
said
they
would
merely
order
defendant
to
pay
7s
6d,
at
the
same
time
cautioning
him
not
to
try
to
settle
3uch
affairs
with
blows.—-Abraham
Coles
charged
George
Thome,
of

with
striking
him
in
the
face
on

27th
ult.
Complainant
said
that
on
the
day
in
question,
as
he
was
driving
a
thrashing-machino
at
Bonsoa,
on
the
road
to
Fiddington,
the
defendant
struck
him
in
the
face
without
any
provocation.
Defendant
denied
this,
saying
that
Coles
was
drunk,
and
insisted
upon
riding
on
the
shafts
of
the
machine;
that
he
fell
off,
and
that
the
wheels
would
have
gone
over
him
had
he
not
not
been
pulled
out
of
the
way.
Defendant
called
a
witness
who
corroborated
his
statement,
and
complainant
was
proved
to
ba
drunk
when
he
carried
the
summons
to
the
policeman.
The
Bench
dismissed
tho
case.

Comtton
PAUNCEFOOT.—This
little
village,
picturesquely
situated
amongst
a
group
of
hills,
presented
quite
a
military
appearance
on
Thursday,
the
16th
inst.,
the
occasion
boing
a
parade
of
tho
Wincanton
troop
of
Yeomanry
Cavalry
before
the
Captain,—Sandford,
Esq.
The
troop
mustered
in
the
Castle
yard
at
10
a.m.,
and
after
a
slight
repast,
proceeded
to
a
field
between
Compton
and
North
Cadbury,
where
they
were
put
through
various
evolutions
and
the
sword
exercise
by
the
new
drill
sergeant,
late
a
member
in
tho
sth
Dragoons.
For
the
first
few
minutes,
everything
seemed
to
be
going
wrong;
but,
after
a
fow
explanations
and
orders
from
the
stentorian
voice
of
the
sergeant,
the
men
fell
into
their
places,
and
the
rest
of
the
drill
was
gone
through
with
remarkable
steadiness
and
precision.
All
the
sight-seers
of
the
neighbourhood,
including
the
parishes
of
North
and
South
Cadbury,
Comptor,
Blackford,
Sutton,
Sparkford,
&amp;c.,
turned
out,work
being
entirely
suspended.
The
fair
sex
was
well
represented,
from
which
it
may
be
augured
that
a
large
portion
of
the
troop
consists
of
eligible
young
men.
After
the
drill,
the
troop
returned
to
the
Castle,
where
C-»pt.
Sandford
had
had
preparations
made
to
comfort
the
inner
man
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day,
and
the
gallant
volunteers
showed
that
they
understood
tho
use
of
the
knife
and
fork
better
than
that
of
the
sword.
Two
members
of
the
troop,
belonging
to
the
neighbourhoods
of
Wincanton
and
Glastonbury
respectively,
(ono
of
whom
rode
a
horse
of
a
rich
strawberry
and
cream
colour,
highly
decorated
with
dirt,
and
the
other
a
charger
which,
in
point
of
age,
might
have
done
duty
at
tho
battle
of
Waterloo)
wore
requested
by
the
Captain
to
procure
better
specimens
of
horse
flesh
before
the
"Bath
week."
A
bystander
suggested
that
the
two
gallant
yeomen
had
not
had
time
to
get
more
than
the
frame
work
finished,
and
that
they
would
perhaps
have
a
coat
of
flesh
put
on
some
day.

The
Bridport
Railway.—Tha
report
of
the
directors
has
been
issued,
and
shows
a
slight
decrease
of
traffic,
the
receipts
being
£2,770
6s
2d
in
1869,
as
against
£2,916
17s
5d
in
1868.
The
decrease
was
ascribed
to
the
slowness
and
unwise
arrangement
of
the
trains,
owing
to
which
passengers
are
most
inconveniently
detained
at
Maiden
Newton,
and
are
deprived
of
a
convenient
oorrespondenoe
with
the
London
and
South
Western
Railway
at

say
they
have
frequently
protested
against
the
loss
and
inconvenience
thus
occasioned,
but
without
effecting
any
improvement.
Hope
is
held
out
that
the
disputes
with
the
Great
Western
Railway
may
yet
be
amicably
settled.
The
directors
advised
a
dividend
at
the
rate
of
six
per
cent,
per
annum
on
the
preference
shares
for
the

House,
shoemaker,
of
Dorchester,
and
Ambrose
Brown,
of
Puddletown,
shoemaker,
were
oharged
with
having
violently
assaulted
Robert
Ree
and
Henry
Whitty,
of
Came,
on
18th
inst.
Complainants
were
drinking
at
the
Phoenix
Inn,
on
Saturday
night
between
eight
and
nine
o'clock,
when
prisoners
and
another
man
looked
into
the
house
but
did
not
say
anything.
Ree
and
Whitty
left
the
house
soon
afterwards
and
went
down
Churoh-street,
on
their
way
home,
with
a
man
named
Hellier.
When
they
were
near
Mr.
Mason's
brewery,
prisoners
and
their
companion,
a
short
man,
overtook
them.
Tho
short
man
snatched
away
a
stick
that
Whitty
was
carrying,
and
struck
him
across
tha
head
with
it.
Whitty
fell,
and
wa3
struck
several
times
about
his
head.
When
Ree
interfered,
he
also
was
knocked
down.
Hellier
shouted
"
Murder,"
and
Mr.
Webber
and
Mr.
Lamphrey
ran
to
their
assistance,
but
before
they
arrived
Whitty
and
Ree
had
got
their
heads
broken
in
several
places,
their
hair
was
matted
with
blood,
and
their
features
were
scarcely
recognisable.
House
and
Brown
were
captured;
the
third
man
got
away.
The
wounded
men
were
taken
to
the
County
Hospital,
where
they
were
carefully
attended
to
by
Dr.
Oowdell
and
Mr.
F.
W.
Young,
the
house
surgeon.
On
Sunday
they
were
able
to
go
to
their
homes;
but
they
appeared
in
court
with
their
heads
bandaged,
and
exhibiting
terrible
proofs
of
the
violent
treatment
they
had
received.
The
above
facts
were
deposed
to
by
complainants
and
Charles
Hollier;
and
prisoners
were
remanded
until
Friday
(to-day)
as.Supt.
Pcuncy
said
he
had
ascertained
who
the.
third
man
was.
Defendants
declared
they
did
not
interfere
;
and
that
the
short
man
did
all
the
mischief.
The
only
reason
that
can
be
assigned
for
the
assault
is
that
prisoners
had
a
grudge
against
Whitty,
as
he
is
a
trapper
of
rabbits
in
the
employ
of
Mr.
Symes,
of
Came.
House
is
at
present
under
a

assault
upon

Whitty

Robert
Ree,
particulars
of
which
are
given
above.
Prisoner
was
identified
by
Whitty,

being
the
man
who
so
violently
assaulted
him,

his
statement.

Mr.
Grantley
Berkeley
on
the
Destruction
op
Birds.
—The
following
letter,
signed
"
Grantley
F.
Berkeley,"
and
dated
Alderney
Manor,
Poole,
Sept.
14,
has
appeared
in
the
Times
Sir,
—Having
seen
in
the
Timed
of
the
18th
inst.
a
correspondence
on
the
wanton
destruction
of
birds,
in
this
country,
originated
by
that
humane
naturalist,
the
Rev.
F.
O.
Morris,
I
beg
to
offer
the
following
remarks.
The
wanton
destruction
of
our
singing
birds,
as
well
as
all
others,
exists
not
only
through
the
gun,
but
by
cruel
thefts
of
the
birdsnester.
I
adduce
an
incident
for
your
espeoial
notice.
On
observing
a
crowd
of
young
men
and
boys
one
Sunday
afternoon
occupied,
as
it
seemed
to
me,
with
some
sort
of
gamo,
after
taking
an
observation
at
a
little
distanoe,
I
went
up
to
them
and
found
as
follows
:—They
had
been
birdsnesting,
and
were
in
possession
of
soveral
nests
containing
eggs
and
very
callow
young.
The
nests
consisted
of
blackbird,
thrush,
robin,
wren,
and
hedge-sparrow.
The
miserable
amusement
of
these
louts
consisted
in
placing
an
egg,
or
a
living
little
bird,
on
the
road,
about
eight
yards
from
a
scratch
made
in
the
dust.
One
of
the
party,
by
turns,
then
assumed
a
stick,
when,
his
eyes
being
blinded
by
a
handkerchief,
ho
was
placed
on
the
scratch
and
told
to
walk
a3
near
as
he
could
guess
to
the
egg
or
poor
little
bird,
stop
there,
and
strike
three
blorcs.
If
he
struck
the
object
in
the
given
number
of
blows
he
won
what
there
was
to
win
;
if
he
missed
hi
3
blows
ho
lost.
That
fact
I
gathered
from
what
I
saw,
but
I
heard
nothing
of
any
wager,
and
therefore
could
not
interfere.
By
the
side
of
these
wanton
ruffians
there
lay
a
crushed
heap
of
little
feathorless
birds,
and
in
the
dust
the
moisture
and
shells
of
broken
birds."

Young

Christian
Association.
—
Ten
years
ago
this
society
was
formed
for
the
moral
improvement
of
the
young
men
of
this
town,
and
it
has
been,
to
a
certain
extent,
successful.
Although
suocesa
has
followed
the
exertions
of
the
committee,
this
success
is
not
equal
to
what
it
might
have
been,
had
a
greater
exertion
b«en
made
by
each
individual
member
for
the
welfare
of
the
society.
Young
men
who
join
associations
of
this
kind
should
not
only
give
their
namos
and
annual
subscriptions
but
give
a
portion
of
their
time
and
talent
in
developing
the
aims
of
tho
oommitteo.
It
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
ensuing
winter
season
may
prove
an
eminently
successful
one
in
the
annals
of
the
Association,
and
that
the
monthly
programme
of
events
will
show
that
every
member
is
amxious
to
do
his
utmost
for
the
society.

call
upon
all
the
members
to
make
an
effort
to
attend
the
weokly
meetings,
and
to
induce
others
