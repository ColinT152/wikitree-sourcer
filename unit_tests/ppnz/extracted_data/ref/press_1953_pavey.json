He was dragged by his norse and kicked on Monday evening, and taken to the Timaru Public Hospital, where he died during an operation. Mr Pavey was born in England. He came to New Zealand at an early age, and worked on a number of Canterbury farms before returning to England to farm there. At the outbreak of war he joined an anti-tank unit in England and went with it to the Middle East, where he joined up with the First Echelon of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force, rising to the rank of lieutenant. After the war Mr Pavey returned to New Zealand, and soon afterwards married Miss Elizabeth Acland, a daughter of Sir Hugh Acland and Lady Acland, of Christchurch. He then bought Litton Farm. Mr Pavey was a former president of the Timaru-St. Andrews branch of Federated Farmers, a committee member of the South Canterbury Hunt, and a member of the Titnaru Agricultural and Pastoral Association, and he served as a churchwarden at Otipua. Mr Pavey is survived by his wife and four children."
